# PlatinumSpeed

This is the github repo of PlatinumSpeed, a barebones, speed-optimised fork of PlatinumQuest from marbleblast.com
It combines files from the latest repo of PQ (2.4.2), the original version (2.0.0) and from the 2016 demo, this will make the game faster for people who have found a decrease in FPS after update 2.6.0.

## Running PS
To run PlatinumSpeed, you will need to have made a copy of your PlatinumQuest folder (Windows) or .app file (macOS). This includes any exe/dlls, the `plugins` dir, and `packages/boot.pak`. Or, if you want to build the plugins from source, clone and build [MBExtender](https://github.com/PlatinumTeam/MBExtender) and install it into `Marble Blast Platinum`.

## Important note for Mac players
Please note the PlatinumSpeed, nor PlatinumQuest is compatible with macOS Catalina (10.15) or later due to there no longer being any support for 32-bit applications. Use macOS Mojave (10.14) or earlier if you are on a Intel Mac. Apple Silicon is not compatible without use of an x86/Intel Virtual Machine.
